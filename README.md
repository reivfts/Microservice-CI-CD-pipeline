# Microservice-CI-CD-pipeline

Assignment 5 for ML and Microservices in the Cloud:

You are leading a DevOps team responsible for managing at least five independent microservices within a distributed application ecosystem.

Task:
Design a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that enables each microservice to be:
Developed, tested, and deployed independently
Integrated seamlessly with other services in the system
Maintained with high stability, traceability, and automation across environments
Your pipeline design should address:
Version control structure (e.g., mono-repo vs. multi-repo strategy)
Build and test automation for individual services
Containerization and image management (e.g., Docker, container registry)
Service-level CI/CD workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI)

Deliverables:
A detailed documentation of your CI/CD pipeline design, including architecture diagrams, YAML workflow examples, and explanations of your tool choices.
An accompanying video presentation (5â€“10 minutes) explaining your pipeline setup, demonstrating how the independent microservices move from code commit to deployment while ensuring continuous integration and system stability.
Evaluation Criteria:
Pipeline modularity and scalability
Integration reliability across microservices 
Clarity of documentation and diagrams
Demonstrated understanding in the video presentation
